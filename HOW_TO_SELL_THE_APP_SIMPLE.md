## 🎯 How to Talk to Training Centers (Step by Step)

- Operations Manager 
- Business Development Manager

**How to find them:**
- Google "training centers near me"
- Check LinkedIn
- Visit their websites
- Go to training industry events

---

### Step 2: The Magic Opening Line 🎪

**Say this EXACT thing:**

> *"Hi! I help training centers increase their course bookings by 30% using gamification. Students love competing with each other, and it makes them book more courses. Can I show you a 5-minute demo?"*

**Why this works:**
- You mention **money** (30% increase)
- You mention **fun** (gamification)
- You ask for **just 5 minutes**

---

### Step 3: Show Them the Magic ✨

**Demo this sequence:**

1. **Show the achievement feed** - "Look, students see when others complete courses"
2. **Show the badges** - "Students collect these like Pokemon cards"
3. **Show the leaderboards** - "Everyone wants to be #1"
4. **Show the numbers** - "This center got 40% more bookings in 3 months"

**Key phrases to use:**
- "Your students will LOVE this"
- "It's like making training into a video game"
- "Other centers are making thousands more per month"

---

### Step 4: Handle Their Worries 🤔

**When they say:** *"It sounds expensive..."*
**You say:** *"Let me show you the math. If you get just 2 extra students per month at £800 per course, you've made £1,600. Our Gold plan costs £1,299. You're already £301 ahead, and most centers get 15-20 extra students!"*

**When they say:** *"Our students are older, they won't like games..."*
**You say:** *"That's what everyone thinks! But competition is human nature. A 60-year-old plumber still wants to beat his mate to the top of the leaderboard. We've seen it work with all ages."*

**When they say:** *"We need to think about it..."*
**You say:** *"I understand. How about a 30-day free trial? No risk, and I'll set everything up for you. If you don't see more bookings in 30 days, cancel with no charge."*

---

### Step 5: Close the Deal 🤝

**The magic question:**
> *"Would you like to start with Silver or Gold? Most centers your size love Gold because of the live feed feature."*

**Never ask IF they want it - ask WHICH ONE they want!**

## 📞 Your Sales Script Template

### **Phone Call Script:**

**You:** "Hi, is this [Name]? I'm calling about helping training centers increase bookings by 30%. Do you have 2 minutes?"

**Them:** "Maybe, what is it?"

**You:** "We created an app that turns training into a game. Students compete with badges and leaderboards, and they book way more courses because they want to win. Can I show you a quick demo?"

**Them:** "How much does it cost?"

**You:** "It pays for itself. Most centers make £15,000 extra per month from the additional bookings. The app costs between £299-£2,499 depending on your size. What matters is the return - would an extra £15,000 monthly revenue interest you?"

**Them:** "Yes, but..."

**You:** "Perfect! Let me show you exactly how it works. Are you free for a 15-minute screen share tomorrow at 2pm or 4pm?"

## 🎯 The Numbers That Sell

### **Always mention these stats:**
- "30-40% increase in course bookings"
- "60% better student retention" 
- "Students complete 3x more courses"
- "ROI of 900%+ in most cases"
- "Pays for itself with just 2 extra students per month"

### **Real example to use:**
> *"We had a plumbing training center in Devon. Before our app: 50 students per month. After our app: 68 students per month. That's 18 extra students × £800 per course = £14,400 extra monthly revenue. Their Gold subscription costs £1,299. Net extra profit: £13,101 per month!"*
